We used 5 models from the sklearn package to predict Attrition:
1. SVM
2. GLM(saturated & reduced model)
3. Decision Tree(with GridCV to find best depth and number of split)
4. Random Forest
5. Neural Network

We also used seaborn for data scaling, sklearn.metrics for performance metrics analysis and matplotlib for visualization.
